Dear my friend, 재용
Hi 재용. I’m 종휘, your roommate.
l have not used e-mail for a long time, so It’s awkward. If you find any awkward sentences or words, just ask me, then I tell you about that in Korean. Actually, I feel comfortable because I know you are so kind, so you can understand this on your deep mind.
Anyway, I’m playing overwatch, popular game. I think I’m good at this game, but you are not. That’s a pitty. But I think you are better at sport game than shooting game. 
I’m done. I want to know your story. I’m looking forward to your answer.
From talented 종휘.

Dear my friend, 종휘.
I read your e-mail. When I did, I was surprised. Because It’s so perfect in grammar and word choice., so I think It’s same as book of 공학영어. 
About game, your word is right. More even I am  painful when playing shooting game.. I’m more interested in ball than gun.
Now, today i watched ‘Man In The Dark’, scared movie. This movie broken my heart. In this movie, lead rolls are thieves and they aim to rob blind old man’s house. However the blind is retired soldier. So he is so experienced that is good at battle. My blood froze in a  scene that turning off lights, he says ‘you are same as me’. When I started to watch, I think the blind as good person. But He’s not. If you wonder the reason, just watch this movie and feel thrill. I recommend this movie to you. I'm done ,too.
From more talented 재용.

Dear 재용
My turn came, again. i saw the movie you recommended, a few days ago. The scene have making your blood froze was scared me, too. Now, I’m writing e-mail beside you watching another movie. I think you love watching movie. I worried Chinese assignment. There are a lot of volume. I have to write Chinese character three times. I think It’s a very hard work, isn’t it? I had not learn Chinese before have entering university, so I have to spend many times studying Chinese. It’s a hard process, on other hand It’s quite fun. Because if I will be good at Chinese, it’s mean I will be trilingual. Since I was child, I always though people using 3 languages are awesome. How about you?

11/22
Good Day 종휘
Hi. My answer to your question is ‘NO’. I heard on internet “A person using 3 languages has shorter lifetime than a person unable, because person’s brain gets stress when the people use 3 languages. Because of this reason, I don’t study Chinese hard intentionally. I want to live young and healthy.
I think a person being good at computer is cooler than a person able 3 languages. That is a reason entering computer-science. But I feel hard to follow our major course. For example professors teach us to crawl in the beginning. Next time, they teach us to walk and to sprint. I understand it to crawl form to sprint. But next step is to fly. Are you kidding me? There are lots of gaps between to sprint and to fly. But, strangely, in fact there are students flying. Every major time, I feel I have to study harder.

Good day 재용
Reading your e-mail, I surprised. Because the reason you entering computer-science is same to my reason I entering. Anyway I was disappointed to you because my name saved on you phone. When you saved my phone number, you name as just ‘2학기 룸메’ ! In that time I was smiled but actually I was sad inside.
Now you are exercising hardly with dumbbells. When you started exercise, you was very skinny. Now you are a little skinny. What I’m saying try to is there is a change. I feel you are bulking up. It is hard to exercise everyday. If you continue this to vacation, you may be ultra. I will cheer up you. CHEER UP~!

11/23
Dear 종휘
Your words right. To exercise everyday is so hard. But ,surely, now It become my daily life. So, I congratulate myself. And thanks for your cheer. I feel better than before. Nowadays I’m studying accounting hard. Because mid-term was done, I was joying my campus life without thinking  term-end examination. But ,one day, I feel  term-end examination is beside my left little toe. From that time, I have studied . Whenever I sit a chair, I want to catch my smartphone. I think using smartphone is a waste of my life. Government must punish themselves and the person developing smartphone.
Anyway my older sister called me a moment ago. Do you have a sister?

11/24
Dear 재용
Hi 재용. Your e-mail’s text is just excuse. It’s always hard to study to me, too.
Anyway ,about your family, I don’t have any sister. I have two brothers. Older one and younger one. Older has 2-old term to me. Younger has 6-old term to me. I heard you don’t have any brother. If there are three boys except father, there isn’t house, but jungle.. Have you heard ‘the law of the jungle’ ? 
I learned this law when I was 6 olds. There were a lot of event at my childhood. Mother bought 2 ice-creams afternoon. If I were not there, mine was nothing. Those event was daily life. As a result ,now, I am gluttonous. Could you tell me about your family?

Dear my friend 종휘
I started league of legends. I do not know about lol. Can you help me? I like the champion to attack from a distance. I want to be a champion who can attack at a distance and run away easily. Do you have a good champion to match me? My friends started from a long time ago and I think I started too late. I played sports games too much.

11/28
Dear my friend 재용
Yes I have not done much league of legends but I have reached the max level! How about teemo? It was teemo that I first met because my friends resemble the teemo every day, and teemo can attack them at a distance like you said, but the disadvantages die easily. But it's fast character that can give big damage to opponent at once. I have one max level ID is really Teemo one champion.

11/28
Dear my friend 종휘
I played Teemo you said. It was really funny. Why was not I interested in the league of legends? Nowadays the overwatch turn up and the interest in the lol has been reduced a lot. Funny games are always just funny and popular once. However, League of Legends was first level in the graph pcroom game time ranking share for a very long time. I still have a fun lol.

Dear my friend 재용
Good morning. You are in 공학영어 time. Friday will be a lot tired, but you're not sleeping l and writing hard. The final exam is well received! Because you like to share letters with me often, you will have a lot of English skills. And I was watching Harry Potter, and you saw Harry Potter! I've seen it all. Where have you been?

11/30
Dear my friend 종휘
Hello! I saw Harry Potter almost to the end. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince are especially so sleepy that I have not seen them for a few days until I have slept and slept. Harry Potter was fun though! Quidditch is a really fun game. How did this creator think about these games? Is not Golden Sneak a miracle? Harry Potter's eating the Golden Snitch is still vividly memorable.

Dear my friend 재용
I too was impressed with Harry Potter that scene. But do you remember the last time Voldemort and Harry Potter were confronted? That scene was fun too. If you get a chance later, I'll come with you to the next Harry Potter series. Are you going with your girlfriend? You bastard. you're still busy with your girlfriend, but thanks for writing email in 공학영어. We're already done
